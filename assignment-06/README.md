# Assignment 06
## Brittany Streissguth

1. Every single time I log into a website I'm using a form. Whether it's to login to Moodle, or access my email on a website, or search for a recipe on my favorite food blog. We might not realize it, but we wouldn't be able to move around the internet without forms. They tell the website we're on what we want to do next.
2. Example of a -
Text Input: Search bar to find something within a website.
Selection: We often use a Radio Button or Checkbox in online classes when taking quizzes to select one or more correct answer.
Button Input: When shopping online, there are multiple forms to fill out, and then a "Submit" or "Complete Purchase" button that sends the information to the business we're purchasing from to send us our items.
3. Work Cycle:
I created the html document - I added the head and the body, and copied and pasted the meta data from Assignment 05, changing the details appropriate to Assignment 06. I then added the contact info for my favorite Seattle boutique. I created a table with the store operating hours, and I created a form getting customer feedback for preferred method of contact. I also added an address element as well as email link.
