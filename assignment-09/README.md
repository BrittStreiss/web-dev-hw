1. Different Selector Types;
-Universal: this indicates style to apply to the whole page. Ex: one uniform font, or background color for the whole page.
-Element: Specifies a particular element, such as a heading, that the style will apply to.
-Class: Specifies that everything in a particular "div class=""" will be styled a certain way.
-ID: Differentiated by the # sign, this indicates everything in a class id will be styled a certain way.

Each of these gets more and more specific when it comes to styling. If you want your whole page to only use one font, you would use the Universal Selector. If you want your page broken up into blocks, you would use the Class Selector. And if you want each of those blocks to be different colors and to have different details, you would use the ID Selector.

2. I chose a 60's theme for my site for Assignment 09. I chose 5 colors (including the background color).

3. I kept this site fairly simple, as I'm still grasping the details we learned of CSS. I played around a bit with my colors, positioning, opacity, font. I still don't have a great understanding of "position", and how to align images where I want them. I also couldn't quite figure out how to make the text background less opaque without also making the text the same opacity, so I chose to make the images less opaque for this one.
I made pretty much each line/image on the site a new div, which seemed like the easiest way to specify the CSS for each, but maybe not the most efficient?

For most of the assignments so far, we've been able to come up with content as we go, but this one required some prior planning and somewhat of a vision of how I wanted the site to look before starting it. I appreciated the new realm of creativity. I wasn't able to execute it exactly as I pictured it, but learning is the name of the game.
