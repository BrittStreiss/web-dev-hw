1. Different Font Categories:
System Font: font already installed on your computer, meant for printing, not necessarily use on the web. Usually limited to use in branding or logos.

Web Font: Fonts found on the web and hosted by a server, not necessarily found on your computer already. (Google Fonts is an example resource for web fonts).

Web-Safe Font: Fonts available on all systems (or most) and will always show up as intended by the developer. (Arial, Times, Courier New...)

2. The importance of having a fall back font or a font stack is so if you use a font hosted by an outside server, and someone's computer can't find it, there is a web-safe font for it to "fall back" on.

3. I thought I would be most excited about color, but I was even more excited to dive into the world of fonts. They really do set the tone for the page.
I decided to use a post from my personal blog about a trip I took to Iceland a couple years ago. I utilized the things we learned about different fonts, how to change their color or weight, and how to apply a pseudo element and pseudo class to a link, which adds a fun flare.
I solved a problem I'd been having with image alignment. I kept trying to use "text-align", but that wasn't working, so I specified a class for the image and applied CSS to it. I also revisited what we read about links in the past and figured out how to open the link in a new window rather than the same one.
