      <p>I know everybody says that they <i>"had the idea first”</i> when something becomes super popular. But I really did. Ok, not FIRST. But I remember when I was living in LA (about 5-6 years ago), I read an article that said Iceland is a great place for women to travel alone. I had never heard of anyone traveling there, but I was totally down for that, and I put it on my short list. And apparently at that very moment, so did the rest of the world, and I didn’t actually get there until last month.</p>
      <p>A few years ago, my best girlfriends and I were heading to Germany to visit another college bestie and we had a layover in Iceland and vowed to come back together on our next international trip.</p>
      <p>So without further ado, I won’t make this too fluffy. I’ll tell you what we did, what we loved, what I want to go back and do – I won’t tell you what I would skip because I don’t really believe that anything should be actively skipped when you’re visiting a place for the first time. Maybe you do something and say, “I don’t need to do that again,” but I would never take the experience away from you in the first place...</p>
