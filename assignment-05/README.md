# Assignment 05
## Brittany Streissguth

1. A document has one <head> element and one <body> element. The <head> is where all the "background information" is for the website - where the metadata is kept. i.e. title, description, author, etc. And the body is where all of the details of what is seen on the website is located, and consists of structural markup and semantic markup.
2. Structural Markup is embedded information about what you see on the website. It delineates headings, paragraphs, list types, etc.
Semantic Markup gives meaning to the words - it might emphasize certain words, underline them, put them in quotes, etc.
3. For this assignment, my work cycle consisted of, creating the html document - first adding the head and body. And then I did the things I have practiced before, such as adding headings and paragraphs into the body. I then went in and added the meta to the head, and changed the specifics so they made sense for my website. I then added my lists, ordered and unordered. I then made sure I had the proper commands for my email, I also added links to the external website I pulled my recipe from, and I added the campus address at the bottom of my page.
