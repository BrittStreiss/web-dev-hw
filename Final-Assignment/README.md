##Final Assignment

1. Pretty much everything I learned this semester was new! I've had a blog for 4 or 5 years, but always farmed out the design/development stuff and when I had an issue I had to rely on someone else to help me fix it. I'm obviously no expert just after this class, but it does give me a little extra confidence boost that I can look at the back end of my site and at least understand what it's telling me. I had never used Github or Atom before, so those things will both come in handy in the future.

2. The most fun things I learned this semester that I didn't have much experience with before was color and typography. It was great experimenting with different colors and I could spend all day researching fonts and which ones go best together.

3. For this assignment, I started by creating a clear vision about what I wanted - I learned early on, that's key. It's pretty hard to put things somewhere you don't know you want them.
I figured out how many pages/tabs I wanted in my menu and created that first, much in the same way we created a menu with a dropdown menu for assignment 12. I then made sure I had all the photos and media I wanted to use, and then added the content to all the different pages, creating links between some of them. Positioning is still, and I'm sure will continue to be the hardest part for awhile, but I made it work! And I had fun.
