1. My experience overall learning HTML has been positive. I had little to no experience prior to this class - I was able to copy and paste small things here and there, and embed photos/video into my blog, but never understood what I was looking at when going over the back end of my site.
It still feels a little overwhelming, thinking about creating a site from scratch and figuring out how to make it look exactly how you want it to look. I know most of that is CSS, which we have yet to cover, but the little we have learned about "Style" so far has probably been the most tedious.
The most interesting thing to learn has been familiarizing myself overall with how HTML is supposed to look. It's fun to know that I can look at the HTML of any site and at least sort of know what I'm looking at.
2. I'm excited to learn everything about CSS. Aesthetics are important and I'm excited to learn how to execute a vision and promote a feeling with the "look" of my site.
3. Work Cycle:
I started by adding the 4 main elements, as well as the usual meta elements to my document. I then created my Nav bar and the separate Divs. Then I added style and played around with that quite a bit - background color, link color, alignment, etc. I added my images and link to the video. I then added content to my About and Contact pages - I added email links and a form. I then made sure I had a legal disclaimer and checked all my links to make sure they worked.
