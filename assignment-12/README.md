##Assignment-12

1. My imaginary client was me (sort of). I made a mock-up of a blog site with a space for text and images, as well as links to a photo gallery, travel guides, and a contact form. I thought it would be good to have a landing page with links to wherever visitors would want to go from there - photos, guides, online shop.

2. Difference between display: block, inline, and inline-block:
Display: block - turns inline elements into block elements.
Display: inline - goes with the content on the page, flows horizontally.
Display: inline-block - adjustable margins and spacing.

3. For this assignment, I first sat down and decided what kind of site I wanted to build - what my "client" would want out of it. Then I drew out how I wanted it to look. I created the html for the menu and styled it first since it would go at the top of the page. Then I wrote the html for the rest of the page, including the working contact page link and form. There was lots of trial and error with positioning and experimenting with the CSS and the most efficient way to label things in html to then style them later. I'm still working on placing things exactly where I want them, but practice practice practice.
